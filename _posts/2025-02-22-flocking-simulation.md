You know what's fascinating about both animation and robotics? They both try to create natural-looking movement, just from completely different angles. In animation, we fake it with careful timing and spacing. In robotics, we build it from the ground up with mathematical models. This project was my attempt to bridge that gap - creating coordinated group movements that look natural while being mathematically sound.

## The Challenge

Getting multiple agents to move together naturally is tricky. Think about a flock of birds - each bird only knows what its immediate neighbors are doing, but somehow they create these beautiful, coordinated movements. I wanted to recreate that using distributed control algorithms, where each agent makes its own decisions based only on local information.

## How It Works

Each agent in the simulation follows three main rules:

1. **Stay together**: Agents try to maintain a comfortable distance from their neighbors
2. **Move together**: They try to match velocity with nearby agents
3. **Don't crash**: They avoid obstacles and each other

Simple rules, complex behavior - kind of like how simple animation principles can create complex, lifelike movement.

## The Results

The simulation shows some interesting behaviors under different conditions. You can see these in action:

- [What happens when parameters aren't quite right](https://youtu.be/vipvhkDKgF0) - the flock doesn't have strong enough attractive pull and they all diverge
- [When we get it tuned properly](https://youtu.be/0H-RWii3nu8) - the flock efficiently reaches its goal
- [Static target acquisition with obstacles](https://youtu.be/UR5oA-l4V2g) - navigating through a complex environment
- [Moving target tracking](https://youtu.be/3q1r9iyXw14) - following a dynamic target
- [Obstacle avoidance while tracking](https://youtu.be/kOSNw5gHd4E) - combining all behaviors together

This project was a perfect example of how different fields can inform each other. My animation background helped me recognize when the movement looked "right" or "wrong," while the robotics side gave me the tools to actually make it work. It's not just about the math - it's about creating movement that feels natural and purposeful.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PlayWeird/flock) if you're interested in looking under the hood.

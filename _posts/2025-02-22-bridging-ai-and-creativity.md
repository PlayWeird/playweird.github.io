You know that moment when you stumble across something that just clicks? For me, it was watching a neural network learn to play Super Mario World. There I was, probably procrastinating on some animation deadline, when I found myself watching [Seth Bling's MarI/O video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44). A neural network, through trial and error, figuring out how to navigate Mario through a level. No pre-programmed rules, just learning from experience. I was hooked.

## The Plot Twist

Here's the thing - I wasn't always the ML researcher I am today. I spent years in digital animation, where every day was a new technical puzzle wrapped in a creative challenge. Want to make a character's hair move naturally? That's both an artistic problem and a coding one. Need to streamline a repetitive animation sequence? Time to attach some code to those animation-object expressions.

Little did I know, all those years of solving creative problems with technical solutions were basically a bootcamp for what I do now. Turns out, the gap between making animated characters move believably and making robots perceive their environment isn't as wide as you might think.

## Why I Do What I Do Now

These days, I'm at the Nevada Center for Applied Research, working on perception systems that could actually make my hometown of Reno a better place. We're developing AI that can inspect infrastructure - things like automated damage detection for bus stops and shelters. It's one thing to work on cool tech, it's another to walk past a bus stop and think "hey, our systems are helping maintain that."

What we're building is pretty neat:
- Multi-modal perception systems that combine cameras, GPS, and motion sensors
- Detection systems using YOLO and Visual Question Answering models
- Few-shot learning approaches that make our systems more efficient

But what really gets me excited is how this tech could make a real difference in local communities. It's not just about the algorithms - it's about making sure our public infrastructure stays safe and well-maintained.

## The Human Side of Machine Perception

Here's something you might not expect: my practice of meditation has actually informed how I think about machine perception. When you spend time really focusing on how you perceive and process the world around you, you start to see interesting parallels with how we're teaching machines to do the same thing. Both humans and robots have to filter out noise, focus on what's important, and make sense of complex sensory input.

## What's Next?

A significant milestone approaches - I'll be defending my PhD dissertation this April 2025. It's been a long journey to get here, with its share of challenges and moments questioning if this was the right path. But here we are.

Meanwhile, I'm deep into developing these inspection systems, pushing the boundaries of what we can do with frontier LLM models and trying to make our damage classification more efficient. And with my PhD completion on the horizon, I'm actively exploring new opportunities to apply my expertise in ML and computer vision. If you're working on interesting problems in perception systems or AI, let's talk. But I'm always interested in connecting with others who are excited about this stuff.

Stay tuned for more posts about perception systems, AI development, and maybe the occasional parallel between meditation and machine learning. No promises on the posting schedule, but I'll keep it interesting.

*P.S. If you're wondering - yes, I did eventually finish those animation deadlines, even after falling down the neural network rabbit hole. You can check out one of my animated projects, Spacefish, [here](https://youtu.be/Pd-7Jculi_E?si=k23f5xb9vgtYWtQo).*

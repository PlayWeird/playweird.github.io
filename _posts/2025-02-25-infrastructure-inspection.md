Bus drivers shouldn't have to be infrastructure inspectors too. Yet that's exactly what's happening in most transit systems today - drivers are expected to visually inspect bus stops for damage while simultaneously maintaining schedules, ensuring passenger safety, and actually driving the bus. This creates an unnecessary cognitive burden and often results in inconsistent or delayed damage reporting.

To solve this problem, we've developed an automated Bus Stop Infrastructure Monitoring System that combines three technologies: automated data collection, geographic processing, and AI-powered visual damage detection.

## From Expensive Prototype to Practical Solution

Our system went through multiple iterations to reach its current form:

**First Generation**: Our initial prototype used a Velodyne Alpha LiDAR system and specialized cameras. While it worked, it cost a prohibitive $110,000 per unit and generated terabytes of data per route. It also needed to be removed during vehicle washing - hardly practical.

**Second Generation**: We switched to a Livox HAP LiDAR, reducing costs to $3,000 per unit with more manageable data storage requirements. This version could be mounted inside the vehicle but still required an external computer.

**Final Generation**: The real breakthrough came when we leveraged recent advances in AI, particularly vision-language models and monocular depth estimation. This eliminated the need for expensive LiDAR entirely, allowing us to extract detailed 3D information from standard camera images while simultaneously assessing infrastructure conditions.

At just $800 per unit, our current system integrates:
- High-resolution 12MP camera
- Dual 1MP depth sensors
- Integrated IMU and GPS
- Built-in Raspberry Pi for processing

## How It Works: A Three-Stage Detection Pipeline

Our system employs a sophisticated process to monitor bus stop infrastructure:

1. **Geofence Matching**: The system uses GPS data to match images to specific bus stop locations, ensuring complete coverage of each stop.

2. **YOLO Detection**: Our custom-trained YOLO model identifies and localizes bus stop infrastructure, providing precise bounding boxes around key elements.

3. **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: State-of-the-art vision-language models perform detailed damage assessment, with support for both cloud-based models (like Claude-3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4V) and local models that can run without internet connectivity.

The system includes a database of few-shot examples showing both damaged and undamaged infrastructure, allowing the VQA models to make accurate assessments based on real-world examples.

## Benefits Beyond Cost Savings

While reducing the per-unit cost from $110,000 to $800 is impressive, the real value comes from operational improvements:

- **Driver Focus and Safety**: Drivers can concentrate fully on safe vehicle operation and passenger service.

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Unlike manual inspections, which may be inconsistent or influenced by factors such as time of day or weather, our system provides regular documentation of every bus stop.

- **Enhanced Inspection Quality**: The multi-stage detection pipeline provides standardized assessment criteria, multiple viewing angles, systematic categorization of damage types, and historical tracking of condition changes.

- **Strategic Maintenance Planning**: The system enables identification of patterns in infrastructure damage, geographic clustering of maintenance needs, early detection of developing issues, and data-driven prioritization of repairs.

## Putting It All Together

The system is implemented through a suite of specialized Python applications designed for efficient processing and review of infrastructure data. Each component supports scalable operations and future expansion.

Most importantly, this solution transforms infrastructure monitoring from a manual, subjective process into a data-driven, systematic operation that supports proactive maintenance and strategic planning.

With successful implementation, this system can serve as a model for other transit authorities seeking to modernize their infrastructure monitoring capabilities while improving working conditions for drivers and maintenance staff.

## Code Coming Soon

I'll be publishing select components of this system on GitHub in the coming weeks, including:
- Our custom-trained YOLO model for bus stop infrastructure detection
- The geofencing system for stop identification
- Sample prompts for the VQA damage assessment pipeline

Stay tuned for updates!

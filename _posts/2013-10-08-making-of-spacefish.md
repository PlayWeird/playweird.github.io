If you've ever wondered what happens when you combine sleep deprivation, flying termite infestations, and the stubborn belief that animation doesn't have to look like everything else on TV, you'd get something close to the making of Spacefish.

## How It All Started

Spacefish began with a painting. My childhood friend Jim Agpalza (an incredible artist and illustrator) had created this strange, compelling image that sparked something in me immediately. I saw potential that Jim himself probably didn't even realize was there. I essentially had to drag Jim through this entire production process kicking and screaming, though I think in hindsight he's really glad I did, as it has led to a great career as a freelance artist for him. Some friendships are built on mutual enthusiasm; ours was built on me having enough enthusiasm for both of us.

The story itself became this weird mirror of my own life—the struggles to find meaningful work, the search for connection, and my sometimes annoying tendency to overthink everything. Lazlo (one of our cosmic protagonists) basically became my animated therapy session, though I'd never admit that to his face. He'd never let me hear the end of it.

## Breaking Animation Rules

By 2013 (when we finally finished the pilot), I was honestly tired of how samey most animated shows had become. Every other show was either crammed with pop culture references that would age like milk, or following the same visual cookbook. We deliberately stripped away most modern references, though we couldn't help but leave a few very specific jabs and easter eggs for the eagle-eyed viewers.

## The "How the Hell Do We Do This?" Phase

Looking back, I'm amazed at our audacity. We had no idea what we were doing when we started. Every single day brought a new technical challenge:

"How do we make a walk cycle that doesn't look like every other walk cycle?"
"How do we animate a swarm of Sadflys without losing our minds?"
"Is there a way to make this character look like they're actually feeling something?"

And we had to solve these with almost no budget and the limited internet resources of pre-YouTube-tutorial-explosion era. Stack Overflow and obscure animation forums became our best friends.

## The Digital Collage Method

One of the things I'm still most proud of is our visual approach. Because of our budget constraints, we had to get creative. All of our backgrounds were digital photo collages manipulated to look simultaneously foreign yet strangely familiar. 

Jim digitally painted all the characters with incredible detail—I still maintain he's one of the most talented illustrators I've ever worked with, even if I had to practically chain him to his desk to hit deadlines. I developed a system for rigging his art and creating a 2.5D environment for these 2D character rigs. It was a strange hybrid approach that gave Spacefish its distinctive look—something that still holds up today. I genuinely think it looks more interesting than 95% of what's currently out there.

## The Remote Work Pioneers

Another major challenge was having our creative team scattered across the country. This was years before COVID made remote work mainstream, so we were figuring out pipelines and communication systems on the fly. We used Dropbox to share files and had daily phone conversations to keep everything on track. We were surprisingly efficient despite the distance, maintaining a structured workflow that kept the project moving forward.

The hardware constraints were another significant hurdle - getting capable machines for our artists when working with such limited resources was a constant challenge throughout production.

## The Flying Termite Studio

We eventually rented an apartment to use as an office, which came with its own unique feature: a flying termite infestation. Every single morning, I'd come in and vacuum up a layer of winged creatures that would emerge at sunrise. Nothing says "professional animation studio" quite like starting your workday with pest control.

## The Unexpected Career Path

Spacefish unexpectedly shaped my professional future in ways I never anticipated. To automate animations, we started using Expressions (a form of JavaScript) in After Effects. Though we mostly cut and pasted code from online resources rather than writing it from scratch, I saw firsthand how valuable programming skills could be for creative work.

When I eventually decided to pursue computer science, it wasn't to become a traditional software engineer—it was because I thought it would make me a better, more hands-on animation producer. Life has a funny way of taking these seeds and growing them in unexpected directions, and now here I am working in AI and machine learning, still thinking about perception and movement, just in a very different context.

## The End, But Not Really

In the end, we never got Spacefish picked up as a series. The pilot is all that exists in the official sense. But the experience of creating it—the friendships, the skills learned, the termites vacuumed—that's something that continues to influence everything I do.

If you haven't seen it yet, take a minute to watch Spacefish. I could try to describe what makes it unique, but honestly, you'll feel it for yourself within the first few frames.

# Technical Projects

Here you'll find my technical projects that showcase the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and practical applications.

## Bus Stop Infrastructure Monitoring System

An innovative AI-powered system that automates the inspection of bus stop infrastructure across city transit networks. By combining computer vision, geographic processing, and advanced AI models, this system eliminates the need for bus drivers to manually inspect stops, allowing them to focus on safe operation and passenger service.

### Key Features

* Three-stage detection pipeline (Geofence Matching, YOLO Detection, VQA Analysis)
* Dramatic cost reduction from $110,000 to $800 per monitoring unit
* Self-contained operation with high-resolution cameras and depth sensors
* Multiple AI model support (both cloud-based and local options)
* Comprehensive bus stop condition tracking and historical analysis
* Flexible mounting options for diverse transit vehicle types
* Strategic maintenance planning through pattern recognition

## uTooth: Automated Tooth Segmentation

A deep learning approach to automating forensic dental analysis using 3D U-Net architecture. This project reduces the time-intensive process of manually segmenting teeth from CT scans from hours to seconds, helping forensic anthropologists identify victims more efficiently.

### Key Features

* Achieved 91.3% segmentation accuracy using 3D U-Net architecture
* Developed custom preprocessing pipeline for CT scan standardization
* Created efficient jaw isolation algorithm
* Implemented Focal Tversky loss for robust training

## Multi-Agent Flocking Simulation

A Python implementation of distributed control algorithms for coordinated movement of autonomous agents. This project combines my interests in animation and robotics, using principles from both to create natural-looking group behaviors while handling complex scenarios like obstacle avoidance.

### Key Features

* Real-time visualization of flocking behavior with OpenGL
* Multiple movement patterns for target tracking
* Dynamic obstacle avoidance using virtual agents
* Performance metric tracking and visualization
* Adaptive visualization scaling

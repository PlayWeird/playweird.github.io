# Technical Projects

Here you'll find my technical projects that showcase the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and practical applications.

## uTooth: Automated Tooth Segmentation

A deep learning approach to automating forensic dental analysis using 3D U-Net architecture. This project reduces the time-intensive process of manually segmenting teeth from CT scans from hours to seconds, helping forensic anthropologists identify victims more efficiently.

### Key Features

* Achieved 91.3% segmentation accuracy using 3D U-Net architecture
* Developed custom preprocessing pipeline for CT scan standardization
* Created efficient jaw isolation algorithm
* Implemented Focal Tversky loss for robust training

## Multi-Agent Flocking Simulation

A Python implementation of distributed control algorithms for coordinated movement of autonomous agents. This project combines my interests in animation and robotics, using principles from both to create natural-looking group behaviors while handling complex scenarios like obstacle avoidance.

### Key Features

* Real-time visualization of flocking behavior with OpenGL
* Multiple movement patterns for target tracking
* Dynamic obstacle avoidance using virtual agents
* Performance metric tracking and visualization
* Adaptive visualization scaling

## Infrastructure Damage Detection

An AI-powered system for automated inspection of public infrastructure. Using computer vision and multi-modal sensing, this project streamlines maintenance workflows for city services by automatically detecting, classifying, and reporting damage to structures like bus shelters and benches.

### Key Features

* Multi-stage detection pipeline using YOLO architecture
* Visual Question Answering for detailed damage assessment
* GPS and sensor fusion for precise location tracking
* Integration with municipal maintenance workflows
* Few-shot learning capabilities for new damage types

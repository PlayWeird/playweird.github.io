# Technical Projects

Here you'll find my technical projects that showcase the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and practical applications.

## uTooth: Automated Tooth Segmentation

A deep learning approach to automating forensic dental analysis using 3D U-Net architecture. This project reduces the time-intensive process of manually segmenting teeth from CT scans from hours to seconds, helping forensic anthropologists identify victims more efficiently.

### Key Features

* Achieved 91.3% segmentation accuracy using 3D U-Net architecture
* Developed custom preprocessing pipeline for CT scan standardization
* Created efficient jaw isolation algorithm
* Implemented Focal Tversky loss for robust training

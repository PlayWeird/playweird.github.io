# Hello, I'm Gaetano

I'm a machine learning researcher specializing in perception systems and computer vision, currently focused on developing AI solutions for autonomous infrastructure inspection. My background spans both technical and creative disciplines, giving me a unique approach to problem-solving in AI and ML applications.

## Professional Focus

At the Nevada Center for Applied Research, I work on cutting-edge perception systems that combine multiple sensor modalities (RGB cameras, GPS, IMU) with advanced ML models. My expertise includes:

- Designing end-to-end perception pipelines
- Developing multi-stage object detection systems
- Implementing efficient data processing workflows
- Creating modular tools for automated quality assessment
- Working with frontier models like YOLO and VQAs

## Background

My path to AI began unconventionally. After years of directing animation projects and building creative teams, I discovered neural networks through a fascinating demonstration of AI learning to play Super Mario World. This sparked my curiosity about machine learning and perception systems, leading me to pursue both a BS and MS in Computer Science and Engineering, where I focused on machine learning and robotics.

## Current Work and Interests

My work in perception systems is informed by a deep interest in how both machines and humans process and understand their environment. This curiosity, combined with my practice of mindful meditation, brings a unique perspective to my technical work in:

- Computer vision and sensor fusion
- Large Language Models and Visual Question Answering systems
- Efficient data processing and pipeline optimization
- Automated damage detection and assessment systems

## Looking Forward

I'm seeking opportunities to apply my technical expertise in machine learning and computer vision to solve complex real-world problems. My combination of technical skill, creative background, and analytical mindset allows me to approach challenges from unique angles and develop innovative solutions.

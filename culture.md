# Finding My Cultural Fit

I believe the best work happens when there's alignment between personal values and organizational culture. My background spans creative direction, community education, and technical innovation - all informed by a deep mindfulness practice that shapes how I approach problems and collaborate with others.

## Mindfulness as Foundation

My daily practice combines elements of Buddhist meditation and Non-Dual Shiva Tantra, focused on developing presence that extends beyond formal sitting sessions. This isn't just a personal ritual - it's a practical approach that influences how I:

- **Solve technical problems** - Bringing full attention to complex challenges without getting lost in mental loops
- **Collaborate with teams** - Listening deeply before responding, recognizing when ego is driving decisions
- **Navigate uncertainty** - Maintaining equanimity when projects hit inevitable roadblocks
- **Balance creativity and precision** - Knowing when to let intuition lead and when analytical thinking is needed

For me, mindfulness isn't separate from work - it's the operating system that runs underneath everything else. This integration of presence has proven particularly valuable in both my animation work (where noticing subtle details matters) and machine learning development (where seeing patterns others miss can make the difference).

## Community Engagement

My community involvement has spanned educational initiatives and technology events:

### First Tech Challenge (FTC)
*Game Announcer, MC, and Score Keeper (2018-2020)*

As MC for robotics tournaments, I created an engaging environment for young engineers, providing:
- Live play-by-play casting of robotics matches
- An informative and exciting atmosphere throughout events
- Technical support as a score keeper

These events showcase incredible creativity and resourcefulness as students solve complex engineering problems under time pressure - something I find genuinely inspiring.

### ChessKidz
*Teacher (2013-2014)*

I taught chess to elementary school children across multiple schools in Reno. Chess offers valuable skills beyond the game itself:
- Strategic thinking and planning several moves ahead
- Learning from mistakes and adapting strategies
- Developing patience and concentration
- Understanding consequences of decisions

## Animation & Creative Work

My animation projects have been featured in museums, film festivals, and specialized screenings across the country. These creative endeavors required intense focus, technical problem-solving, and collaborative leadership:

### Spacefish
This animated series represents years of creative direction and production:

- **BizarroCon** - Portland, Oregon (2012) - *Episode 1: Help Unwanted*
- **Nevada Museum of Art** - Reno, Nevada (2012) - *Leslo and the Fish Brigade*
- **Nevada Museum of Art** - Reno, Nevada (2010) - *The Only Flower Stand* (2nd Place Jury Award, 3-Minute Film Festival)

### Tony Clifton Productions
As an animator and production assistant for Comic Relief, I worked on several Tony Clifton projects that received notable screenings:

- **MoMA (Museum of Modern Art)** - New York, New York (2013) - Part of "The Andy Kaufman Effect: Comedy in the Expanded Field" exhibition
- **FF2 - NOLA Indie Film Festival** - New Orleans, Louisiana (2013)
- **Egyptian Theatre** - Los Angeles, California (2011)

## Life Outside Work

Beyond my professional endeavors and community involvement, I maintain a balanced life through various hobbies and activities that keep me grounded and energized.

### Adventures with Artemis

My adventures in the Reno area are often shared with my hiking companion, Artemis. Together we explore the beautiful trails around the Sierra Nevada mountains.

### Music & Creativity

Playing bass guitar provides a different kind of creative outlet than my technical work. The rhythm and feel of bass playing requires a different mindset - one that balances technical precision with intuitive groove. It's a perfect complement to both my animation background and current technical work.

### Outdoor Pursuits

Living in Nevada offers incredible access to natural beauty:

- **Paddling:** Exploring local lakes like Tahoe, Pyramid, and Donner from the water perspective
- **Hiking:** Discovering new trails throughout the Sierra Nevada range
- **Desert exploration:** Finding beauty in Nevada's unique desert landscapes

## What I Bring to Company Culture

Organizations that would benefit from my particular approach tend to value:

- **Integration over compartmentalization** - I don't separate "technical me" from "creative me" or "mindful me"
- **Process awareness alongside outcomes** - Recognizing that how we work shapes what we create
- **Authentic communication** - Direct yet compassionate feedback that avoids both harshness and sugar-coating
- **Learning through experimentation** - Willingness to try approaches that might fail but will definitely teach
- **Community impact** - Connecting technical innovations to real human needs

My current work in AI perception systems for infrastructure inspection represents a perfect integration of these values - using technology to solve practical problems that improve community well-being, approached with both technical rigor and creative problem-solving.

## Career Evolution & What I'm Seeking Now

My career journey has had its distinct phases. The younger version of me - the animation studio founder and creative director - would have thrived in the chaotic energy of early-stage startups. That version of me embraced uncertainty, wore multiple hats, and navigated the constant pivots that define startup culture.

While I still value creativity and innovation, my priorities have evolved. Today, I'm seeking:

- **Stability with growth** - A well-established organization where I can deepen my expertise while having the security to take calculated risks
- **Mentorship opportunities** - Access to experienced leaders in ML and computer vision who can help me continue developing my technical skills
- **Clear development paths** - Structured opportunities to grow both technically and professionally
- **Work-life integration** - An environment that values sustainable pace and recognizes that burnout doesn't lead to better outcomes
- **Purpose-driven work** - Projects that connect to meaningful impact, whether that's improving infrastructure, enhancing safety, or solving other substantive problems

I bring the creative problem-solving skills from my animation days, the technical capabilities from my ML research, and the mindful approach that ties it all together. But rather than seeking the adrenaline rush of startup uncertainty, I'm looking to apply these skills in an environment where I can build something lasting.

## The Continuous Thread

Whether I'm debugging a perception system, teaching chess to children, or directing an animation team, I'm bringing the same quality of presence and integration. This continuity across diverse activities is what allows me to adapt quickly to new challenges while maintaining consistency in my approach.

Companies that foster cultures of mindful innovation, authentic communication, and meaningful impact are where I thrive and contribute most effectively.
